WEATHER STATION with Arduino Sensors Plugged-In to a Raspberry Pi 3+
(Inspired By Vasileios Chroniadis)
(Electronics Development and Programming Development by me) 

# First started at Friday 01 November 2019
# Stopped 13 0f March 2019
# My best friend told me to
# Never stop until you are satisfied
# He also told me to K.I.S.S
# (Keep It Simple Stupid)
# Fist code is been scraped and shredded
# Second and last code (See Below)
# Started at 13 October 2020
# And been Delivered at 23 October 2020

Things I've learned through this project
a) I was impressed what I have achieved with so little electronics
b) the value of my determination
c) the little time to complete my code and delivered it @ the school
d) the pressure to achieve this

It should stand out as a work because 
a) all the codes are developed by me
(not a single line was stolen or copied)
b) for anyone who wants to copy this code he/she should consider contacting anyone of us 
(cause the code is gifted to the future generations of 2nd EPAL Larissas)
c) It could be an official work
(but made it for free)

# This code is been funded by Noesis S.A
# And belongs to the Greek Ministry Of Education
# with the Management for Secondary Education of Larissa
# lastly to the 2nd EPAL Larissas
# And all of it's parts
# This code is been developed by Dawnvibe
